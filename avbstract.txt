The application of statistical data analysis is becoming increasingly
important across all research fields, driven by greater data availability
and accessible programming languages, such as Python. However, many
researchers do not adequately verify and discuss essential data assumptions,
leading to potentially incorrect results. This thesis introduces a practical,
assumption-focused guide on the e↵ective application of statistical methods,
with an emphasis on the often-overlooked step of verifying data assumptions.
Unlike traditional guides that focus soley on the technical implementation
of statistical methods, this work addresses the consequences of assumption
violations and o↵ers alternative approaches to ensure that findings remain
valid and interpretable, even when ideal conditions are not met. For each
method, the guide discusses these consequences and outlines techniques for
checking and satisfying its assumptions. To enhance applicability, the thesis
includes a case study with a real-world dataset from a European labour union,
demonstrating how this guide can contribute to a reliable churn analysis.
This work encourages a more conscientious approach to data analysis, thereby
improving the quality of research outcomes.
